# Sonja's Music Theory Personal Project

## *What will the application do?*
#### Teaches the basics of music theory

#### Key signature identifier
- Be able to correlate a key signature to the potential keys that could have that key signature

#### Has a history interface and reviewing interface
- Allows user to add past looked at and searched about key signatures into a collection

## *Who will use it?*
Music students or those who are interested in music who would like to learn more about music and improve their basic theory skills.

## *Why is this project of interest to you?*
I am currently taking a few music theory courses at UBC, often I use online websites that teach these different types of music concepts. These include music topics such as intervals, key signatures, and note identification. However, I think these websites' implementations of teaching or my user experience using the app is not the best. So I think if I created my own better and improved version of these applications that could help students learn or better understand basic music theory concepts. It could make their lives much easier and more convenient as they could very easily use the app and learn about the music concepts all in one place without any distractions.

## *User Stories*
In the context of a music theory learning app:
- As a user, I want to be able to identify the correct minor key based on the number of the sharps I select for the key signature.
- As a user, I want to be able to identify the potential major and minor keys based on the number of the flats I select for the key signature list.
- As a user, I want to be able to add list of accidental types and number of accidentals of the key signatures that I have searched about into a list of key signatures.
- As a user, I want to be able to view list of accidental types and number of accidentals of the key signatures that I have looked at previously after adding to a collection.
- As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save my searched key signature list to file and have the option to do so or not.
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my searched key signature list from file.
